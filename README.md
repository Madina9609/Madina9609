### 👋 Hello World! I'm Madina
## Junior Data Scientist | SQL Enthusiast | Python Learner | Statistics Explorer

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm on a thrilling journey to decode the secrets hidden in data, one query at a time.

<ins>🔧 Skills & Tools </ins>

**Languages & Technologies**

SQL: Crafting queries like a detective solving mysteries.

Python: Learning to speak the language of snakes (🐍) and data.

Statistics: Using p-values and confidence intervals to make sense of chaos.

**Currently Improving**

Python Coding Skills: Writing cleaner, faster, and more efficient code.

Machine Learning: Teaching machines to think (or at least predict).

Data Visualization: Turning numbers into stories with Matplotlib, Seaborn, and friends.

#🌱 Learning Goals for 2024

✅ Master Pythonic Ways – Writing code that even Python would approve of.

✅ Deep Dive into ML – From linear regression to neural networks (one step at a time).

✅ Build a Data Portfolio – Because actions speak louder than resumes.

#📫 Let’s Connect!
I’m always open to collaborations, learning opportunities, or just a good data chat!

Fun Fact: I once tried to predict the outcome of a coin flip using SQL. (Spoiler: It’s still 50/50.)
